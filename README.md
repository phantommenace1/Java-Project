Java User Input Validation against a Database
This is a java based input validation system. It contains a list of employees in the input.txt file where each employee is an ID, salary, and type. 
The user is expected to enter in 4 of the 10 employees as they appear in the input.txt file
If they succeed, they are notified and the output.txt file is written which contains the list of all 10 employees
If they fail, they are also notified and must try again
